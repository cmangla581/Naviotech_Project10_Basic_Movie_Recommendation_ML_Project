# Naviotech_Project10_Basic_Movie_Recommendation_ML_Project

This is the Basic Movie Recommendation ML project which basically recommends the name of the movies similar to the movie input using the cosine similarity algorithm and also the Tfidf vectorizer which helps in the 
conversion of the text to number, so that the ML algorithm can be applied to it.  

This project iis a pure example of the Unsupervised ML Project which basically operates on the unlabelled dataset to make predictions. 
Here, in this project, one special feature is that as we click the recommend button, then we get the bar graph of the Top 10 related movies plotted and also the cosine similarity heatmap get plotted for the speccific movies relation. 

The Cosine Similarity basically works on calculating the angle in between the two points. The lower the difference, more the similarity.  
Also a streamlit UI has been made to make the project more useful for users.
